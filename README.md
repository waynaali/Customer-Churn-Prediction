## 🔍 Week-wise Breakdown

---

### 📊 Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Data cleaning & preprocessing
* Missing values handling
* Customer behavior analysis
* Key churn patterns identified

### 🔥 Key Insights:

* Month-to-month customers churn more
* Low tenure = high churn risk
* High monthly charges increase churn
* Fiber optic users churn more
* Electronic check users are high risk

---

### 🤖 Week 2: Machine Learning Models

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

### Feature Engineering:

* TotalRevenue
* TotalServices
* Tenure Groups
* High Charges Flag

✔ Random Forest performed best initially

---

### ⚙️ Week 3: Model Optimization

* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch / RandomSearch)
* Cross-validation
* XGBoost optimization

### 📈 Results:

| Model             | Accuracy |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Baseline RF       | ~82%     |
| Optimized RF      | ~86%     |
| Optimized XGBoost | ~88–89%  |

✔ Final Model: **XGBoost (~86–88% accuracy)**

---

### 🚀 Week 4: Deployment (Streamlit App)

* Built interactive web app using Streamlit
* Integrated trained ML model
* Created real-time prediction system
* User input form added
* Risk-based churn prediction output

---

## 🧠 App Features

* Customer demographic input
* Account information input
* Real-time churn prediction
* Risk classification (High / Low)
* Probability score display

---

## ⚙️ How to Run Project

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
